## Hermione Granger Twitter Bot

### A few important things to get everything started:

1. Create a new Twitter account and a new GoodReads account if you don't have them
2. Enter the developer tools section for both sites
3. Generate Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Secret for Twitter and save it in a file: secrets.txt (later this file will be included in .gitignore to protect your info. Do not release these keys to anyone!)
4. Similarly, generate a consumer key and consumer secret key for the GoodReads account, and save this to goodreads.txt (again, be wary and do not release this info)
